## Overview

call accounting package is geared towards small to mid-sized organizations with ad-hoc reporting needs under two million call records, utilizing the full capacity of Microsoft SQL Server Express. The system is available as a single site or multi-site license, allowing multiple users to run reports over all locations. Includes full features of Crystal Run-Time Reporting, with a palette of over 200 Apogee report templates. With Apogee's security feature, user access can be limited to reporting on a specific site or department. All Report Generation and time-saving automation features such as Email Merge, Scheduling, and Database Synchronization are available in the Desktop Edition.  

## Design

The portable EEG montoring device (PEMD) is a combination platform of a head-mounted recording system and a portable terminal to be installed on any device running the Android operating system.

The EEG is monitored and recorded using a series of electrodes built into the head-mounted system. The recordings are processed by a microprocessor from analog to digital format, and then sent to the portable terminal via bluetooth.
