## Strategic Data and Telecom, Inc. (SDT, Inc.)

Founded in 1980, SDT has been dedicated to remain at the forefront of the computer-telephony revolution and offer reliable, cost-effective, innovative, management reporting solutions that can be tailored to the demands of an ever-changing marketplace. SDT was an active participant in early CTI efforts to incorporate CDR information from a variety of sources to generate vital call processing information.

## Big Data

The next decade brought another cataclysmic shift with an avalanche of business data generated from all aspects of everyday corporate activities.  Data-centric models began to be developed to obtain an understanding of this disparate data and it was clear that CUCM data and other VoIP data from devices such as SBC controllers were becoming increasingly important components of these models.  SDT recognized this shift in emphasis from management reporting to **Data Modeling and Analytics** and has incorporated an arsenal of BI Tools into a core telemanagement product based upon a 35–year-track-record and thousands of terabytes of call records successfully recorded and processed.
